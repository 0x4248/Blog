# First blog

This is the very first MarkdownBlog post to be published.

## What is MarkdownBlog?

MarkdownBlog is a simple simple blog engine that I wrote and it uses markdown pages to generate the blog posts. It is a simple and easy to use blog engine that is perfect for small blogs. It is also fully customisable and can be easily modified to suit your needs. MarkdownBlog is written in Python and is fully open source.

You can find the source code for MarkdownBlog on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/0x4248/MarkdownBlog).  

## How to use MarkdownBlog

To use MarkdownBlog, you need to create a new markdown file in the `content/pages` directory. The file should be named `page.md` and should contain the content of your blog post. You can then view your blog post by navigating to `<DOMAIN>/www/<PAGE_NAME>`.

## Why did I create MarkdownBlog?

I created MarkdownBlog because I wanted a simple and easy to use blog engine that I could use to quickly turn my markdown files and notes into fully fledged blog posts. The problem is I dump all this on github gist and it is not easy to read and can be hard to find. So I created MarkdownBlog to solve this problem where it puts all my markdown files into one site where people can easily read and find my notes and blog posts.

## Why use markdown?

Markdown is a simple and easy to use markup language that is perfect for computers and humans to read. Markdown was created by John Gruber back in 2004 and has now become one of the most popular markup languages on the internet [1](#references).

Here is an example of a markdown file:

```markdown
# This is a heading

This is some text

- This is a list
- This is another list item
```
