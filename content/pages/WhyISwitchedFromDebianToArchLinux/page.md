# Why I switched from Debian to Arch Linux
***
For several years now I have been using Debian as my main Linux distro but there was one problem with the OS. It is never up to date. I can never seem to get the latest software and most of the time I find myself cloning the source code of the software and building from source just to get the latest version. Because debian is also quite outdated it means that some hardware are not compatible with Linux. 

I have a 2021 Razer blade 15 that I have been trying to get Linux working on for a while now and it seems what what ever I did with Debian it would never have working hardware. So I tried using Arch Linux and it worked first time.

To install Arch Linux I used the archboot ISO which provides alternative arch linux install disks. Archboot comes with a nice installer and drivers to get basic Wi-Fi working. It also installs firmware for you so you are not spending ages installing drivers. Once it was installed I was greeted with a TTY console where I then installed and configured plasma and SDDM.
