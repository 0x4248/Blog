			<hr />
			<p>Recently tech giants have been focusing on AI and on how it can help you as a person get things done. Recently AI models have switched from learning off books and the internet to learning off you as a person. This can be a problem for your privacy.</p>
			<h2>AI and your Privacy</h2>
			<p>In order for an AI model to learn off you and your behaviours the AI model will need to collect lots of information about you and everything you do. For years this has been on social media platforms but not tech giants have been incorporating them into their operating systems.</p>
			<h2>Microsoft recall</h2>
			<p>A good example of this is Microsoft recall. A new AI put into windows that "retrace your steps".</p>
			<h3>Security issues</h3>
			<p>In order for Microsoft recall to work the operating system captures the things you type and takes screenshots of your screen. Then the AI will look at that and learn off what you did. It all sounds like a massive spyware program but the main problem is how Microsoft stores this information. </p>
			<p>Recall stores all this information in a unencrypted database in your <code>appdata</code> folder ðŸ˜². This means a really simple program or malware can just read this database and know all about you.</p>
			<p>An even bigger problem is what this database contains. Recall will just store anything that you type in including banking details and passwords.</p>
			<h2>Why this is a problem for privacy</h2>
			<p>Things like recall will store anything you do but this could also be used by the tech giant and could be sold to third parties. Right now there isn't also much of a way to opt out of AI learning off you.</p>
			<h2>What can be done to stop this</h2>
			<p>Three things:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>AI needs to give consent</li>
			<li>AI needs to train less from your data</li>
			<li>AI needs to store data securely</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>I see AI as an amazing thing but right now it is being misused by tech giants. We need to make sure that AI is used in a way that is safe and secure for everyone.</p>
			<p>Until next time.</p>
